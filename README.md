# Simple Test Upload APP using expressjs

I have decided to not spend time of beautiful view. The default html and simple server. Tryied to complete everything in 2 hours.

The next steps could be:

- add front-end framework or libraries instead of simple render of html from express.
- add css framework and make everething beautiful
- add normal authentication process using JWT or something similar
- refactor backend code to make the structure more clear.
- integration with DB.
- etc.

## Install

```
npm i
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000
